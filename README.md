# Linear-Regression-using-PyTorch
The learning part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights w11, w12,... w23, b1 &amp; b2 by looking at the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data (i.e. to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall and humidity). This is done by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called gradient descent
